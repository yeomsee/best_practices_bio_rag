# Searching for the Best Practices of Query Reformulation in Bio-Insight Generation
This repository contains the source code and essential experimental data for the research paper: "Searching for the Best Practices of Query Reformulation in Bio-Insight Generation" (Submitted to BMC Bioinformatics, 2026).

## 📌 Project Overview
Our research explores the optimal strategies for Query Reformulation to enhance retrieval performance in Bio-Insight generation tasks. Focusing on the Alzheimer's disease domain, we evaluate various reformulation techniques using user-centered queries collected from real-world biomedical research contexts.
